- 👷 I’m Data Analyst at [FoumanChimie Company](https://www.foumanchimie.com/).
- 🎓 I’m Chemical Engineering at [Shiraz University](https://www.shirazu.ac.ir/).
- 🏢 I’m Book Editor at [Kheilisabz](https://kheilisabz.com/).

I'm currently studying Chemical Engineering
at [Shiraz  University](https://shirazu.ac.ir/) and looking forward to study AI in the future.
My favorite programming language is ``` Python ```, I have experience in ``` MATLAB ```  and ``` C++ ``` too.

I joined [FoumanChimie](https://www.foumanchimie.com/) as  Data Analyst at January of 2021. I believe that open source is holy and the ones who can gain money for their researches or codes but publish them for free are the ones who will go to heaven. 😄
